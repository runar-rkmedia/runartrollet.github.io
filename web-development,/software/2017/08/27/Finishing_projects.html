    <p>Like most developers, I love personal projects. As I’ve had my shares of projects in the past which I got tired off, I’ve had to take some steps to keep me from wasting time on projects that don’t see the light of day, and instead focus my energy on the right project.</p>

<p>I’m not alone as a developer struggling with this problem. It is entirely reasonable to be hyped beyond thought by a project for the first few days, and then getting into a bit of a struggle. Either with the solution itself or just time-management.</p>

<p>Developers are doing this on their spare time, between work, chores, obligations and social events. Unless solving the struggle within about a week or two, interest in the project might fast decline, leaving only a graveyard of GitHub projects in its wake.</p>

<p><a href="/images/startup-photos.jpg">
  <img src="/images/startup-photos-800.jpg" alt="Project" srcset="            /images/startup-photos-1600.jpg 1600w,            /images/startup-photos-800.jpg 800w,            /images/startup-photos-400.jpg 400w,            /images/startup-photos-300.jpg 300w,            /images/startup-photos-100.jpg 100w,    " sizes="(min-width: 800px) 80vw, 100vw" class="center" />
</a></p>

<p>To combat this, I show restraint in actually starting a project. I think it over thoroughly. I try to think critically about whether or not my project would be as good as I am hyped to believe. How many people will it be useful to or appreciated by? How much work would an MVP need? I let the project sit for a few days or weeks more, just to let the hype sink in, or withdraw.</p>

<p>Don’t feel bad for abandoning your project. You are not failing it. There are a thousand bad ideas for every good one. Look at it this way, if you follow all the ideas you think of as good, you are most likely wasting your time, or not spending as much time as you should on that one idea that is honestly great. Finish most projects by trashing them after giving them some thought, finish the great ones by investing heavily.</p>

<h2 id="minimal-non-viable-prototype">Minimal <strong>Non</strong>-Viable Prototype</h2>

<p>I then start creating what I call a Minimal <strong>Non</strong>-Viable Prototype. An MNVP (my term) is like a stripped-down version of an MVP or a proof-of-concept. It is, however, for my eyes only. I tackle whatever problem entices me most about the project, which is most often the main-functionality. I don’t address anything more at this point. A useful tool should be able to show its benefits and potential at this stage, even if it requires a fair deal of imagination.</p>

<p>This helps me see if this is a project I still believe in, and whether I should keep at it for a real MWP. I then take another break. After all, I have just tackled the most intriguing problem in my project. Going straight to the boring stuff now would seem like a chore after all that fun.</p>

<h2 id="bridging-to-mwp">Bridging to MWP</h2>

<p>So I’ve tackled the biggest problem and let the project sit to excite me up again. I now generally look forward to bringing the project to life with a working GUI, bells and whistles, and all that is needed to make an MWP.</p>

<p>However, depending on how big the project is, I might need another booster. Luckily, I’ve had a few days off to let fresh takes and ideas step in. These mostly happen while idling,</p>

<p>At this point, getting the project out the gate is more or less just a matter of time. I’ve already had a chance to think it thoroughly over, with multiple low-cost opportunities to trash the whole project.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Personal projects should be fun. Of course, we want to start the next big thing, but that rarely happens. Most projects end up in the trash. With this technique, I hope that trashing projects occur at an earlier stage, with less time spent, and more time left for what matters; family and friends, Xbox, fun, and fulfilling our dreams.</p>
