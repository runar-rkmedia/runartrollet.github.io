The website of Runar Kristoffersen

This is a work-in-progress website. Currently, it doesn't hold much, but I expect it to have to hold my portfolio and possibly a few blogposts.

## About me

I am a up-and-coming developer from Norway. Professionally, I am an electrician. By desire, I am a computer- and sciencegeek. 

I love to create tools to make workflows more appreciative, faster and less troublesome. I often invest time to learn how to automate a mundane task, and over time build better and better practices. 

I do not believe in multitasking, so removing unneeded subtasks is a great way to increase productivity.
