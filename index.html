        <p><p>Like most developers, I love personal projects. As I’ve had my shares of projects in the past which I got tired off, I’ve had to take some steps to keep me from wasting time on projects that don’t see the light of day, and instead focus my energy on the right project.</p>

        <p><p>In this post, I will dive into the technical aspect of how to remap the keyboard. Many software lets you do this, but most will not do this at a low enough level to actually remap the keys. Some just try it’s best to cancel out the effect of the key you want it to remap, and then emulating the target key.</p>

        <p><p>Remapping the keyboard is highly useful, especially if you find that there currently is not enough keys on your keyboard. Instead of slaving though remembering cumbersome key-combinations to get your work done, why not add some extra keys on your keyboard? Of course, we are not physically adding keys, but using the ones we have a bit smarter.</p>

        <p><p>For quite some time I’ve been using just regular flat keyboards, mostly because as a student I used my laptop a lot. When working on my desktop I wanted a similar keyboard, so I went with a flat Logitech-keyboard.</p>
